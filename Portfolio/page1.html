            Iam Apoorva,
            <br>
            I was born in Hubli and bought up in Belgavi.
            All of my education was from Belgavi.
            Owing to the city I grew up in i can speak in about 3 langauges fluently, write in three of them and understand.
            I would describe myself as an ambitious person.
            I like to excel in any field I choose.
            My keen sense towards colors and technology led me towards to web technology.
